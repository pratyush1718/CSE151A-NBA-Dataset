# CSE151A-NBA-Dataset

The data we will be using for the group project is from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmadam97/nba-playbyplay-data-20182019

Specifically we will be looking through play by play data from the 2018-2019 season. 

The goal for our model is to use features such as the text in each observation related to away play as well as some of the player stats columns to help us predict the winner of a game.
For the purpose of the model we will ommit information from the data during preprocessing that would give away information about game outcome as well as non numerical data that isn't very useful (i.e. game location, date, time)

## Data exploration:
 
  We will plot the original data in the form of a histogram, pairplot, correlation matrix, and a heat map.
  We will also print out the list of features that our data starts out with prior to doing the preprocessing. 
  Note: due to the nature of play by play data, for many observations many of the features include null data.
  Note2: the data includes both categorical and numerical data.



## Data Preprocessing:
